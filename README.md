# Polygon and Pyramid
### About project
*Projects goal:* Create a console app using possibilities of OOP. Implement the TPolygon class and inherit from it the TPyramid class.
### Working principle:
In this program, we will try to implement as many OOP features as possible on C ++. Created all types of constructors, re-grinding as many operators as possible (such as <<, =, == ...). We used the friend function, rebooted friend operators. Also, we have methods that find the perimeter, the area, the inner angle and the radius of the inscribed circle of the right polygon. As an option, we can draw a polygon and then dump it to the left for a given number of pixels.
In the second part of this project, we take the already finished TPolygon class and inherit it from another class - TPyramid. This class has such methods as finding the lateral surface, volume, area, and others. We can compare two pyramids, see if they are drowned, diminish or increase the size of the pyramid.
